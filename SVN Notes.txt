Checking out a site after the subdomain has been created and a local copy exists in subclips.

Inside the pca/public_html folder
$ asdf [destination folder(no path)]

Example:
$ svn co -q file:///var/www/svn/repos/sites/trunk/evilution .
  svn co -q file:///var/www/svn/repos/zen .

	
$ /usr/bin/svn/svn co -q file:///var/www/svn/repos/sites/trunk/evilution .

Checkout to a remote server svn+ssh
svn checkout -q svn+ssh://pca@pcanewmedia.com/home/svn/pca/sites/trunk/nhc nhc-dev

(make sure Settings.php is ignored by SVN.)

VI settings.php and change the db login info.

--------
Add files to version control if they were manually transferred via ftp or SCP'd

Example:
$svn status

M /Path/to/file
D /path/to/file1
A /path/to/file1
? /path/to/file2 <--- we want to add this file 

$svn add /path/to/file2
$svn commit -m"comment"

In case of M use [ svn revert /path/to/file2 ] to use the latest committed file version. Be careful that this will over write any file that was manually updated via ftp so be sure to obtain the file yourself.

Branching/Switching/Merging

Do this after you have committed your changes from your branch in subclipse. 
--Switch to branch on dev/live site:
Example:

$svn info [confirm that trunk is currently the repo root url]
Repository Root: file:///home/svn/pca/sites/branches/amir-....

svn sw -q file:///var/www/svn/repos/sites/branches/ai-contactmoduleChanges_7-7-2011 .

$svn sw -q file:///home/svn/pca/sites/branches/tor-joe-hotelsPage-2011-05-20 . [. inside current dir]
or 
$svn sw -q svn+ssh://pca@174.132.68.210/home/svn/pca/sites/branches/cvs-joe-introGalleryUpdates-2011-06-22 .

$svn up [shouldn't display anything but nice to see it]

-------
Merge Your Changes after you have completed your branch changes in subclipse

Dry run [for testing] inside of dev/live folder.
[5279 is obtained from subclips 'Branch History'][HEAD is latest revision from my branch]

$svn merge --dry-run -r 5279:HEAD file:///home/svn/pca/sites/branches/tor-joe-hotelsPage-2011-2011-05-20

Assuming no conflicts are displayed re-do command without --dry-run:

$svn merge -r 5279:HEAD file:///home/svn/pca/sites/branches/tor-joe-hotelsPage-2011-2011-05-20

Then Commit your merged files to the site.
[comment is obtained from subclips. Branch dir]

$svn commit -m"svn merge -r 5279:HEAD file:///home/svn/pca/sites/branches/tor-joe-hotelsPage-2011-2011-05-20"
